They look slimy and yucky\
But they are surprisingly dry\
Just like your mom\
On that night back in July

They are squishy and soft\
And a little slippery\
No I am not talking about b4lls or b00bs\
I am talking about something that lives in our campus’s greenery

They are hard to catch\
They hop away fast\
Try catching one\
I’m sure you will have a blast!

Some are fat some are thin\
They do absolutely nothing\
Hold them in your palm or put them in your pocket\
They don’t care because they have 0 survival instincts

You can do whatever you want with them\
Make them a pet and watch them grow\
Take them on walks, feed them insects\
Make them a ball to play catch and throw!

Did you figure out who I am talking about?\
I’m pretty sure you got it dawgs\
Congratulations, you are correct\
I am talking about frogs!
